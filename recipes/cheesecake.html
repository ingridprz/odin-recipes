    <h2>Description</h2>
    For a recipe with so few ingredients cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla & salt), it took a lot longer than you might think to develop the perfect version. I’ve shared a few cheesecake variations in the past, including my No-Bake Cheesecake, but getting a perfected classic version took lots of testing. Finally, here we are.
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    Graham Cracker Crust
    <ul>
        <li>½ cups graham cracker crumbs (170g)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons butter (melted)</li>
    </ul>
    Cheesecake
    <ul>
        <li>32 oz cream cheese (softened to room temperature)</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cups sour cream</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs (room temperature, lightly beaten)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C).</li>
        <li>Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring well. Add melted butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well.</li>
        <li>Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of your pan. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).</li>
        <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).</li>
        <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
